# UFOs

## Purpose
The purpose of the module was to build a table using stored data in a JavaScript array.The purpose of this challenge is to use JavaScript and HTML to modify the index.html code to create more table filters.

## Results
* The website is finished and looks great, the data table can be filtered in five different ways, by date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO. Here is what the data table looks like unfiltered:

* To filter the table you simply need to put the filter you want in the correct filter box, press enter and the data will automatically filter.
* Here is what the data table looks like filtered to only disk shaped UFO's:

## Summary
One drawback of this website is the data is never updated because the data was pulled from a local data base. To fix this the data should be pulled from a live data base that gets updated, so the website will update when new data is added. One other recommendation i would have for this website is for it to have more imfortaion provided in the data table, as i feel there isn't a whole lot there.
